# Empire Tri Club Memberships

This is an add-on for [WooCommerce Memberships](https://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-memberships/). By default, WooCommerce Memberships begin as soon as a customer purchases a product that grants them access to the membership. Admins can set durations for memberships but can't specify start and end dates. This add-on allows for the creation of memberships with start and end dates, allowing for things like [Empire Tri Club's seasonal membership](http://empiretriclub.com/product/seasonal-membership/).
